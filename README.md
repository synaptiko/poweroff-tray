What it is?
===========
Simple utility which I'm using in i3wm to quickly powering off or restarting my computerâ€¦ It will place icon into system tray area. This icon will have two action on right-click: *Power Off* and *Restart*. Left click will call *Power Off* which is default action.

Dependencies
============
- `python3`
- [`pystray`](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray)
- [`zenity`](https://library.gnome.org/users/zenity/stable/)
- `bash`

How to install it?
==================
Clone this repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside it.

How to use it?
==============
Add the following into your i3 config file (e.g. `~/.config/i3/config`):
```
exec --no-startup-id /home/xy/SomeStuff/poweroff-tray/run.py >& /dev/null &
```

You'll also need something like this in your `suders.d` file:
```
user machine= NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/shutdown now, /usr/bin/reboot, /usr/bin/systemctl hibernate, /usr/bin/systemctl suspend
```
